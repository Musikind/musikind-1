    "musicFirstText": "The Music Profile document template allows us to gather information regarding a person's life experience of music. Set 10-15 minutes aside to get started on filling out the Music Profile. Once you have got started you can add it to it as more and more information is gathered during the person's stay in care. The Music Profile helps us understand the musical history of the individual is it for, and it's practical use is that it helps us build person-centred music playlists",
    "musicSecondText": "Throughout our lives we listen to a lot of music. Some songs will stay significant to us for decades and may remind us of a certain period in our life or a certain person. A part of our brain called the amygdala can create associations between outside sensations such as sound, taste, scent etc. and internal feelings and memories",
    "musicThirdText": "The take away from this is that the music we love throughout our lives can give us access to many past experiences and memories that we may have lost touch with but that are significant parts of our life history and identity. Having frequent access to these pieces of music can support our identity and give us a stronger sense of familiarity",
    "musicFourthText": "A Music Profile gives us a resource from which we can create CDs or digital playlists of music which are important to the person and relevant to their preferences. To gather the information, we can ask the individuals, their family and friends and research the decades in which they were children, teenagers and adults - sampling the music that may have been popular in their area of the world",
    "musicFifthText": "We must be careful not to include songs that can have a negative emotional impact such as songs that remind individuals of lost family or friends, or a very challenging time in their life. Songs with more challenging associations can be used in allowing people to find a deeper level of acceptance around difficult emotions such as grief, but it is recommended that this is done with the support of a professional therapist",
